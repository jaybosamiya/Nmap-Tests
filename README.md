Nmap-Tests
==========

Testing scripts/analysis that I have written/done to test some parts of Nmap that I've worked on.

+ test\_exclude\_ports.sh - Runs a bunch of tests against Nmap to see if all the necessary requirements of `--exclude-ports` feature of Nmap pass
+ Memory-Analysis - Analysis of the [patch](http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2014/q2/429) I had submitted onto the nmap-dev mailing list.
